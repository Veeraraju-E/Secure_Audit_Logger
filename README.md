# Secure_Audit_Logger

- This is a security-focused project designed to log and monitor system activities, providing detailed information on crucial system events (e.g., file access, process creation, network connections).
- This audit logger will operate in the background at the OS level, ensuring that system logs are both comprehensive and tamper-resistant.
- Itâ€™s particularly useful for identifying unusual behavior or potential security incidents, such as unauthorized access or system breaches.
- We provide separate test for each of the most popular Operatin Systems - macOS, Windows and Linux (Ubuntu)
